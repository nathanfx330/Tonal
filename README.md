Certainly! Here’s an updated version of the `README.md` with a **Seizure Warning** included at the top, as the project involves creating visuals based on audio intensity, which could potentially cause discomfort for some viewers.

```markdown
# Tonal

⚠️ **Seizure Warning**: The visuals generated by this project are based on audio intensity, which may include rapid flashes or changes in brightness. Please use caution if you are sensitive to flashing lights or have a history of seizures.

**Tonal** transforms audio into dynamic visuals by creating videos based on audio intensity. Using a logarithmic scale, it visualizes sound in real-time, creating engaging video representations. Perfect for audio-visual projects, and optimized for easy processing in DaVinci Resolve/Fusion Probe Modifier.

## Features
- Transforms audio into visual representations using audio intensity.
- Creates a video visualization based on the audio's dynamic range.
- Ideal for long-format video projects. Simply place the exported video in a track, create a Fusion script from it, use the Probe Modifier to sample the video, and drive animation in your script.
- Optimized for DaVinci Resolve/Fusion Probe Modifier for video editing.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pydub` library (for audio processing)
- `numpy` library (for numerical operations)
- `opencv-python` library (for video creation)
- `moviepy` library (for video/audio synchronization)
- `ffmpeg` (for video processing)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository:
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tonal.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:
Navigate into the project directory and install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
cd tonal
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install pydub numpy opencv-python moviepy
```

### 3. Install FFmpeg:
Make sure you have `ffmpeg` installed on your system. You can download it from [FFmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Once downloaded, make sure `ffmpeg` is added to your system’s PATH.

## How to Use

### 1. Run the Script:
To use **Tonal**, simply run the script with the following command:

```bash
python tonal.py
```

### 2. Choose an Audio File:
The script will prompt you to select an audio file from the supported formats (`.mp3`, `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi`). Once you select the file, the script will process it and generate a video based on the audio intensity.

### 3. Customizing Segment Length:
You can customize the segment length for video splits in the `split_video` function, which is particularly useful for processing videos in DaVinci Resolve. The default segment length is set to 60 seconds.

### 4. Final Output:
After processing, the script will output a video file with the audio visualization and optionally split the video into smaller segments for easier editing.

## Example Usage

```bash
python tonal.py
```

1. Select an audio file to visualize.
2. The script will generate a video and save it as `audio_filename_final.mp4`.
3. If enabled, the video will be split into smaller segments and saved in the same directory.

### Key Changes:
- Added a **Seizure Warning** at the top of the file.
- The warning highlights potential issues for people who may be sensitive to flashing or rapidly changing visuals, ensuring that the project is used safely.

This should help users be aware of any potential risks before using **Tonal**. Let me know if you need further modifications!
